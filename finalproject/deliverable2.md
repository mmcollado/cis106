### What is Virtualization?
* Virtualization is running a computer inside another computer, but with a difference. The computer running in the virtual machine has a low risk of damage or loss if you break it. A virtual machine can also make it instantly without the worry of getting stolen on the internet because virtual machines are always used for general purposes in case of loss. So you only delete it and create a new one. Furthermore, a virtual machine can store it in remote sources like servers that are computers. The main reason to exist is only to save and store data of any network or user worldwide.
