### What is Virtualization?

  *    Virtualization is running a computer inside another computer, but with a difference. The computer running in the virtual machine has a low risk of damage or loss if you break it. A virtual machine can also make it instantly without the worry of getting stolen on the internet because virtual machines are always used for general purposes in case of loss. So you only delete it and create a new one. Furthermore, a virtual machine can store it in remote sources like servers that are computers. The main reason to exist is only to save and store data of any network or user worldwide.

### Types of virtualization
* **Client-side Virtualization** IS a Virtual machine, but with the differences that are the focus in use with users only with applications. For example, suppose you use your phone daily, and that phone uses an application, you. In that case, the regular user doesn't have access to the server. Instead, you have access to the server, a computer that stores information on the net, to access an application. So your phone as a cloud gaming app like Nvidia cloud or Xbox cloud from your phone, and use the resources. From the server using the app like memory ram, etc. but can't modify what is shown to you. You can't install anything or use anything that is not predetermined set by the server owner.
