### What is Virtualization?

  *    Virtualization is running a computer inside another computer, but with a difference. The computer running in the virtual machine has a low risk of damage or loss if you break it. A virtual machine can also make it instantly without the worry of getting stolen on the internet because virtual machines are always used for general purposes in case of loss. So you only delete it and create a new one. Furthermore, a virtual machine can store it in remote sources like servers that are computers. The main reason to exist is only to save and store data of any network or user worldwide.

### Types of virtualization

* **Client-side Virtualization** IS a Virtual machine, but with the differences that are the focus in use with users only with applications. For example, suppose you use your phone daily, and that phone uses an application, you. In that case, the regular user doesn't have access to the server. Instead, you have access to the server, a computer that stores information on the net, to access an application. So your phone as a cloud gaming app like Nvidia cloud or Xbox cloud from your phone, and use the resources. From the server using the app like memory ram, etc. but can't modify what is shown to you. You can't install anything or use anything that the server owner does not predetermine.
  
*  **Server-side Virtualization** IS the technique of transforming one powerful computer into a machine that stores data and use it from just one device to avoid the excess power consumption and hardware overcrowding do it, but the excessive amount of racks or spaces that need for this task also is not the best idea since server virtualization tends to use the hardware or physical components of a machine and share with all the others virtual servers going to be overwhelming at some point still have many advantages since you can use as regular Server and modified as much as you need it 

### Hypervisor 

### Types of hypervisors

## Virtual Manager

* Virtual Manager or virtual-manager is a graphical front-end hypervisor that supports different types of virtualization such as Qemu, Zen, and Xen used in Linux and Windows. Its primary purpose is to virtualize a virtual machine making it. It is easy to use without going into the terminal using a graphical interface that makes the user install it and manage it easily.
