# Deliverable1
<hr/>

##    Introduction
* I'm going to talk about how to use Endeavour os in daily life as your primary operating system Endeavour os is an active system based on Arch Linux distribution. Witch the difference from ubuntu that has deb package in an arch all can be compiled, and can be precompile even is not from their package manager. They are trying to sol the problem. With ubuntu distribution, packages take a long time to release in Endeavor or any other arch-based distro. This fact does not happen since these arch base distributions have the most recent updates of everything.
  
##    Project hardware and software requirements
* Processor 1ghz minimum intel or amd.
# Ram:
* Gnome â€“ A minimum of 4GB of RAM is necessary 
* 10 gbs minimum of disk
  
##  What is Linux?

 * Just like windows os and mac os Linux is an operating system. Still, with the difference that it is open compared to mac os and windows os since it is available to the user, so the user can see the source code and modified at will, also distributed to anyone at 0 costs. Meanwhile, their homologue has a price for a license and controls the hardware and software the same way or better since communities or people around the globe can fix problems quickly and more efficiently than Microsoft or apple.
