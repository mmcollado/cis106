    Click Select Network.

    * Click the name of the network you want, then click Connect.

    * If the network is protected by a password (encryption key), enter the password when prompted and click Connect.

    * If you do not know the key, it may be written on the underside of the wireless router or base station, or in its instruction manual, or you may have to ask the person who administers the wireless network.

    * The network icon will change appearance as the computer attempts to connect to the network.

    * If the connection is successful, the icon will change to a dot with several curved bars above it (). More bars indicate a stronger connection to the network. Fewer bars mean the connection is weaker and might not be very reliable.

### Alternatives

### Chromium

![Chromium](chromium-browser.webp)

Chromium OS is a free and open-source operating system designed for running web applications and browsing the World Wide Web. It is the open-source version of Chrome OS, a Linux-based operating system made by Google.

Like Chrome OS, Chromium OS is based on the Linux kernel, but its principal user interface is the Chromium web browser rather than the Google Chrome browser. Chromium OS also includes the Portage package manager, which was originally developed for Gentoo Linux. Because Chromium OS and Chrome OS use a web browser engine for the user interface, they are oriented toward web applications rather than desktop applications or mobile apps.

Google first published the Chromium OS source code in late 2009.
