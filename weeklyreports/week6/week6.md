## Brace expansion and how to use it

* Brace expansions are useful techniques that help you do every command in short time since with a single command you can create modify and even delete a bunch of files and all kind of things in the terminal and in the work space your are in. 

* How to use it: there are several ways to use brace expansions first one is using a script in the terminal stating with ```#!/bin/bash``` of the specific task you want to use for the other one is using brackets ``{}`` also the regular way using ```/`` in the terminal for the script can use it as this is a complete document specifying what you need to modify or do.  
  ```echo {one,two,three,four}``` also with  
  
  ```for i in {3..7}```
```do```
```echo $i```
```done``` and expanding names and directories ```ls *.txt```
