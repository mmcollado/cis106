## Question 5

**I chose Optimized  Gaming Operating System as a project waiting for evaluation is an excellent concept. However, it is still not very user-friendly to regular users, still charming if you consider that this distro automatically detects all the hardware. What is mounted by default, it sees it no matter what you have. Also, configure all the networks mounted in a distro based on Debian that looks like ubuntu. Hence, the ram consumption is super lovely to run anything in it super fast, but all the process takes a long time still is not well implemented, and buggy once is done runs super fast.**
